  <h2>Double Layer Capacitance in Electrochemical Cells</h2>
  <p>
    The concept of <strong>double layer capacitance</strong> is fundamental to understanding how charge is stored and transferred at the interface between an electrode and an electrolyte in electrochemical cells. This section introduces the basic theory behind capacitors, explores their behavior under different electrical inputs, and relates these ideas to the special case of the double layer at an electrode/solution interface.

  <h3>Basic Capacitor Theory</h3>
  <p>
    A <em>capacitor</em> is an electrical component that stores energy in the form of an electric field between two conductive plates separated by an insulator (dielectric). The ability of a capacitor to store charge is measured by its <strong>capacitance</strong> (<em>C</em>), defined as:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    C = Q / V
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    where <em>Q</em> is the charge stored and <em>V</em> is the voltage across the plates.
  </p>

  <h3>Ideal Capacitor Response</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DC Input:</strong> When a constant voltage (DC) is applied, an ideal capacitor initially allows current to flow as it charges, but eventually blocks further current once fully charged.</li>
    <li><strong>Ramp Input:</strong> If the voltage increases linearly with time (a ramp), the current through the capacitor remains constant because <em>I = C dV/dt</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>RC Circuit Behavior</h3>
  <p>
    In real systems, capacitors are often paired with resistors, forming an <strong>RC circuit</strong>. The voltage and current responses are governed by the time constant <em>τ = RC</em>, which determines how quickly the circuit charges or discharges. RC circuits are foundational in filtering, timing, and signal processing.

  <h3>Double Layer Capacitance at the Electrode/Solution Interface</h3>
  <p>
    In electrochemistry, the <strong>double layer</strong> forms at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte solution. Ions in the solution arrange themselves near the electrode surface, creating a region with charge separation—analogous to the plates of a capacitor. The <strong>double layer capacitance</strong> reflects the ability of this interface to store charge in response to changes in applied potential.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Double layer capacitance is influenced by factors such as electrode material, surface area, electrolyte composition, and temperature.</li>
    <li>It plays a crucial role in techniques like cyclic voltammetry, where the capacitive current can be distinguished from faradaic (redox) currents.</li>
    <li>Understanding double layer capacitance is essential for designing batteries, supercapacitors, and sensors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In summary, double layer capacitance bridges basic capacitor theory and electrochemical applications, describing how charge and potential interact at the nanoscale interface between electrodes and solutions.
